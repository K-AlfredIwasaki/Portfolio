## 1. Data Visualization - NYC Citi Bike
- **Data:** Bike trip data collected for users of a bike rental service in NYC.
- **Data Source:**  [Citi Bike Trip Histories](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- **Objectives:** Find interesting usage patterns in the data and come up with ideas to turn the data into values.
- **Tools:** R and its packages: ggplot, ggmap, and dplyr among others.
- **Techniques:** spacial visualization.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning - Creating Customer Segments
- **Data:**  Product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal.
- **Data Source:**  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers)
- **Objectives:**  Identify customer segments hidden in the data. 
- **Tools:**  Python with its packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn among others.
- **Techniques:**  feature scaling, outlier detection, principal components analysis, k-means clustering.
